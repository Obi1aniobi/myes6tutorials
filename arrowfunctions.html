// Arrow funtion shave 3 main benefits:
// 1: they are much more concise
// 2: they have implicit returns which allows us to write one-liners in code.
// 3: it does rebind the value of 'This' when you use an arrow function inside of another function

//To add 'bos' to the end of all three names in the array above:


//Regular function

const fullNames = names.map(function(name){
    return `${name} bos`;   
});

console.log(fullNames);


//Arrow function

const fullNames2 = names.map((name) => {
    return `${name} bos`;   
});

//arrow function with one parameter:

const fullNames3 = names.map(name =>{
    return `${name} bos`;   
});


//trimming down the arrow function:

// with implicit return ie without the 'return' keyword:
const fullNames4 = names.map((name) =>`${name} bos`);

//with no arguments at all in the function, pass an empty parenthesis:
const fullNames5 = names.map(() =>`cool bos`);

//Arrow functions are always anonymous functions, ie., they are not named functions, therefore, when you use an arrow function, you cannot name them.

//example of a named function:

function sayMyNam (name){
    alert (`Hello ${name}`);
}

//advantages of using a named function:

//if you have a stack trace ie., if you have an error and you intend to figure out where it all went wrong,
//using a named function makes it easier to identify where the error is located. 

//but you can however put them in a variable: for example:

const sayMyName = (name) => { 
    alert(`Hello ${name}!`) };

sayMyName('Peter');
